📚 Academic Thesis – LaTeX Project








This repository contains the complete LaTeX source files for my academic thesis, prepared at Addis Ababa Science and Technology University (AASTU).
 The project demonstrates my ability to design modular, professional, and publication-ready documents using LaTeX — skills I also apply in academic, research, and professional report preparation.

📝 This repository also serves as a portfolio example of my expertise in LaTeX document design, IEEE citation style, and research presentation.
